DR.Kernel multi-turn rejection sampling (MRS) filters.

Port of `verl_patch/trainer/code/filters/` from
https://github.com/hkust-nlp/KernelGYM. The filter logic is unchanged from
upstream — only a dead import was dropped. A `dataproto_adapter` module is
added on top to translate between verl's `DataProto` and the dict-of-tensors
shape `PPOBatchFilter.filter_batch` expects.

Public API:
- PPOBatchFilter, PPOFilterConfig: the filter pipeline + its config
- filter_dataproto: convenience wrapper that takes a `DataProto` and returns
  a filtered `DataProto`
