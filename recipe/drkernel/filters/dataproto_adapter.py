DataProto <-> dict-of-tensors adapter for PPOBatchFilter.

PPOBatchFilter (ported from DR.Kernel) operates on a `dict[str, torch.Tensor]`
plus a `list[str]` of prompt UIDs. Current verl moves data around as
`verl.protocol.DataProto`. This module bridges the two so the filter can be
called with a single `filter_dataproto(batch, config)` and returns a filtered
`DataProto` of the same shape.

Tensor field mapping (verl key -> filter key):
- token_level_rewards (summed) -> rewards          [bs]
- response_mask                 -> response_mask   [bs, seq]
- old_log_probs (optional)      -> old_log_probs   [bs, seq]
- rollout_log_probs (optional)  -> rollout_log_probs [bs, seq]
- top_log_probs (optional)      -> top_log_probs   [bs, seq]
- prompt_index (optional)       -> prompt_index    [bs]

UIDs come from `non_tensor_batch["uid"]`. If absent, every sample is given a
unique UID (effectively disables group-level filtering — only individual
filters apply).
