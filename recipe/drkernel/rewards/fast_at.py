"""Fast@X metric helper for the DR.Kernel recipe.

Fast@X = fraction of kernels that PASS correctness checks AND achieve at least
X-times speedup over the Torch reference. Per-trajectory we emit a 0/1 indicator
for each X; the mean across a batch (training) or across rollouts/prompts
(validation, via `process_validation_metrics`) recovers the Fast@X fraction.
